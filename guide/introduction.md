# Introduction

[__Windi CSS__][windicss] is a next generation compiler for [Tailwind CSS].

If you are already familiar with [Tailwind CSS], think about [Windi CSS] as an alternative to Tailwind, which provides faster load times, and supports all the features in Tailwind v2.0 and more.

If you are not familiar with [Tailwind CSS], you can think of [Windi CSS] as a utility-first CSS library.

## Why Windi CSS? ü§î

A quote from the author should illustrate his motivation to create [Windi CSS]:

<Quote author="@voorjar">When my project became larger and there were about dozens of components, the initial compilation time reached 3s, and hot updates took more than 1s.</Quote>

## Features ‚ö°Ô∏è
